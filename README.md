# math-sandbox
A collection of work-in-progress solutions and visualizations for various math-related problems. Each folder contains code and visualizations where applicable. None of these were created to answer a homework problem or project, but simply to explore problems and phenomena I find interesting.

# pisano
MATLAB. Exploring fundamental patterns and properties of pisano periods with graphical visualizations.

# hamming-distance
R notebook. Visualizing in graphical and animated form the binary hamming distances on the integers. Currently exploring how to expand the domain to certain rationals.

# fibonacci-conjecture
Java. Brute force (O(n^3)) testing of my observation that Fn*F(n+k)-F(n+j)*F(n+k-j) = (-1)^(n+1) F(j)*F(k-j) where F(i) is the ith Fibonacci number, i being any integer (negatives included).
